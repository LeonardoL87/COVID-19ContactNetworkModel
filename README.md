# COVID-19 Contact Network Model
Full Contact Network for SARS-CoV-2 
The proposed model is based on a contact network approach. In our model, each node represents a country within a list of 175 countries. The number of countries comes from taking those that report epidemiological data (see data section below). The connections between nodes are deduced from the air connectivity between countries, the number of flights and their frequency. The air routes determine the connection between the nodes of the network and the number of flights and frequency of the same determines the degree of connection. In this way, the weight wji in [0, N] subseteq  mathcalN that connects node i with node j is defined as the number of air routes between both nodes. 

At the node level, to model the infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a population, a stochastic compartmental model was implemented with a discrete population consisting of 26 equations and 16 parameters. The model contemplates the emergence of new strains of the virus. To model this aspect, a logistic-type function was used that calculates the probability that a new strain will emerge in a given country (network node) at time t . On the other hand, a stochastic variable implemented by means of a binomial probability function calculates the appearance of individuals infected with a mutant strain, taking into account the probability as a function of t given by the logistic-type function. The probability is conditioned by the mean of the total number of infected individuals per million inhabitants with the wild strain, in this way the incidence over time is considered and the circulation of the virus in the population is taken into account. To establish the probability that a mutant strain will emerge, the work carried out by citegarcia2021sword was taken into account, where the time required for a mutant strain to appear in a given population is determined given the number of generations per instant of time. In this way, it is established that the probability approaches 1 as time gets longer. 


The susceptible population (S) can move to the protected compartment (P) at rate alpha, and come back to S at rate tau. Susceptible population can be infected by both viral strains (wild and mutant) at rates betaw and betaw respectively. The exposed population (Ew, Em, Ewm and Emw) move to infected compartment (Iw, Im, Iwm and Imw) ) after the incubation period gamma. The infected population is detected at rate delta and moved to compartments (Qw, Qm, Qwm and Qmw) depending on the strain which they are infected. Only non vaccinated population can move to death compartment(D) and we assume that first dose also provides a partial protection against infection of both strains with the introduction of parameter nuV. For simplicity, population fully vaccinated assume immune to both strains. The population that has been infected by both strains acquires total immunity and passes into the RT compartment. On the other hand, having undergone a cycle of infection by one of the two strains (wild or mutant) provides immunity against that strain but not against the other. In this way, the population passes to the Rw or Rm compartment depending on the strain with which they were infected.

The infection rate in the model was modeled in two different ways. On the one hand, a seasonal rate is contemplated in, which is calculated taking into account a sinusoidal function dependent on time t as can bee seen in the model equations bellow. On the other hand, when the effect of temperature is contemplated, a function T(t) is used. This function measures the effect that daily temperature has on the infection rate and is calculated as an inverse relationship to the mean average temperature of the last 10 years.

The model runs on a daily time scale, the passage of time between days t0 and t1 is 1/24, which means that each day is divided into 24 hours. Transitions between nodes, that is, the population shift from one node to another is carried out at the beginning of each integration step. This assumes a number of daily flights arriving at node xi from its neighbors xj at the beginning of each integration step. These income and expenses are taken into account when setting the initial values y0 of the system for each node. 

Only the exposed population to wild or mutant strains are taken into account for the transfer function between nodes. This hypothesis attempts to simulate individuals who may escape the control of airlines and governments through PCRs.

The fraction of exposed individuals that can move from node i to node j on a daily basis is calculated taking into account the probability of infection at node i. To calculate this fraction, proceed in the same way as before. The value of the population exposed in this case corresponds to the cargo capacity of the airplanes (between 200 and 400 passengers) and the number of airplanes that daily communicate between node i and node j
